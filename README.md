# Student Roster Project Java
#### Last Update: July 2020

The program manages the enrollment roster that are used in school classes. Staff and professors are given a list of choices to add, drop and search a student. All students are stored in a Binary Search Tree which compares students last name, then first name, and finally their ID. If the class is full, then students will be added in a waiting list queue (FIFO). The finalized roster is then saved in an output.txt file.
